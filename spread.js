let number = [10,20,30,40];

let a = Math.max(number)

//console.log(a);  // this will return NaN .because 10203040 is works as string ...

console.log(...number);   // this will return alll value which array has
//this upper works like rest .... this represent as 10 20 30 40s

console.log(...a)  //this will not work --- > max only will be one ..
